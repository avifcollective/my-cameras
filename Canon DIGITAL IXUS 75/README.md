# Canon DIGITAL IXUS 75

My first flea market find. I bought it at 5 euro, which was a scam, because the battery did not work at all, so I ended up spending 20 euro online for a replacement battery, and a charger that barely worked. 

This was the first camera that I ended up buying, so I did not have the UniPal Plus that I have now for charging, so I was stuck with a crappy charger and a battery that worked, but was a pain to charge, as it had to go in at a specific angle

I was over the moon with it though, and it got me into my small hobby of photography, so I have nothing but love for it, even with the unnecessary expenses. 

I bought it before I received the D5300 and D5100, and was really happy using it, but when I got the two DSLRs, I started using those instead, and my friend ended up using this more often, as she wanted to take photos, but didnt know how DSLRs worked, so I operated them instead while she had the small, easy to use camera. I ended up giving her this camera, as I knew she liked it.
